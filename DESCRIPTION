Description: GEOexplorer is a Shiny app that enables 
  exploratory data analysis and differential gene expression 
  of gene expression analysis on microarray gene expression 
  datasets held on the GEO database. The outputs are 
  interactive graphs that enable users to explore the 
  results of the analysis. The development of GEOexplorer 
  was made possible because of the excellent code provided 
  by GEO2R (https: //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/).
